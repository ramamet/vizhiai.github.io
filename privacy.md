## üõ°Ô∏è Vizhi.ai Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** April 2025

### 1. No Data Collection
Vizhi.ai is a **100% local browser extension**. It performs all AI-readiness audits **entirely within your browser**. We do **not** collect, store, transmit, or process any of your browsing data, page content, or personal information.

### 2. No Server Communication
The extension makes **zero external API calls**. All analysis (including scoring across 12 pillars) runs locally using JavaScript and browser APIs. Your data never leaves your device.

### 3. Local Storage Only
For convenience, Vizhi.ai may store audit results **locally** in your browser‚Äôs `chrome.storage` or `IndexedDB` ‚Äî but only to enable features like:
- Historical tracking
- Site-wide audit history
- What-if simulator state

These are **client-side only** and can be cleared at any time via browser settings.

### 4. Third-Party Libraries
We use open-source libraries (e.g., Lighthouse, axe-core, etc.) for certain checks. These libraries also run locally and do not phone home.

### 5. Contact
If you have questions about our privacy practices, contact us at:
